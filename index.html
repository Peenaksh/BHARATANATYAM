	         of many Indian classical dance forms and it originated in TamilNadu
		   . It is principally common in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu and its province;
		     and is nearly 2,000 years old..Bharatanatyam dance is known to be ekaharya,
		     where one dancer takes on many roles in a single performance
		    . In the early 19th century, the famous Tanjore Quartette,under the patronage of Raja Serfoji are said to have been responsible for the repertoire of Bharatnatyam dance as we see it today.
